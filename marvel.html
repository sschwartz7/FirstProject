        <h2>What I know about Marvel</h2>
        <p>
            Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics,[3] and by 1951 had generally become known as
            Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in June 1961 with the launch of The Fantastic Four and other superhero
            titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used
            over the years and decades, was solidified as the company's primary brand.

        <p>
            Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America,
            Thor, Doctor Strange, Hulk, Daredevil, Wolverine, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel, as well as popular
            superhero teams such as the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Its stable of
            well-known supervillains includes the likes of Doctor Doom, Magneto, Ultron, Thanos, Kang the Conqueror,
            Green Goblin, Red Skull, Galactus, Loki, and Kingpin. Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a
            single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major
            characters are based in New York City, New York, United States.[4] Additionally, Marvel has published
            several licensed properties from other companies. This includes Star Wars comics twice from 1977 to 1986 and
            again since 2015.
